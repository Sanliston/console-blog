# Typescript + Next.js + GraphCMS + GraphQL + Tailwind CSS Project

A quick and simple project exploring the full processes involved in creating a blog using services such as GraphCMS. From conception, development, and deployment. As well as leveraging CI/CD. With a primary focus on exploring whether using a third party CMS such as GraphCMS is more viable when it comes to scaling, as opposed to rolling your own.

At the time of writing the project was still in development. However, feel free to access the preview deployments to get a feel of how far the project is.
